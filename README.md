# Hook Game
  In this Project, we designed a game with JavaFX which contains lines, circles, semicircles and disconnectors. Main purpose of this game is clicking to circles in an order to remove the shapes that connected to that circle. The level is completed successfully only if all the shapes are removed from the screen.

  Basic rules of the game:
-The shapes that the circle connected starts to move only if the connection line, which is between circle and disconnector, and disconnectorâ€™s line are on the same dimension. 
-When the shapes that are connected to circle finished to move and getting shorter, connection line and circle will be removed from the screen.
-If a collision happens, level starts again.
-When all shapes are removed from the screen, game passes to next level.
